## RÃ¦n Kararou
### One Hot Wolf

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on super secret projects.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to exist.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Rust projects.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about pretty much anything.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been known by more names than is reasonable.

I'm RÃ¦n.  My pronouns are [fÃ¦/fÃ¦r](https://pronoun.is/fae).  I like UNIX
and Rust.
